## enable-pages.sh

A script that uses the GitHub CLI to enable GitHub Pages with GitHub Actions as the source.

### Prerequisites

- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) installed and authenticated
- `jq` installed for JSON processing

# Run from the repository root
./scripts/enable-pages.sh
```

### What it does

1. **Checks prerequisites**: Verifies GitHub CLI is installed and authenticated
2. **Gets repository info**: Identifies the current repository
3. **Checks Pages status**: Determines if Pages is already enabled and configured
4. **Enables/Updates Pages**:
   - If Pages is disabled: Enables it with GitHub Actions as source
   - If Pages is enabled with wrong source: Updates it to use GitHub Actions
   - If Pages is already correctly configured: Reports success

### Output

- ‚úÖ Success messages in green
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings in yellow
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Info messages in blue
- ‚ùå Errors in red
